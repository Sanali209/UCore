# Single Source of Truth (SSOT) Analysis Report for UCore

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the UCore repository to assess if it follows the **Single Source of Truth** (SSOT) principleâ€”a software design concept where each piece of data or configuration is stored in only one place, and all other references are derived from that authoritative source. Adhering to SSOT helps prevent inconsistencies, reduces duplication, and improves maintainability.

---

## Findings

### 1. **Configuration Management**
- Multiple config files are present: `app_config.yml`, `config.yml`, and `custom_settings.yml` (see `docs/project-structure.md`). It is unclear if one is canonical and others inherit/override, or if they are used for different purposes. This could risk config drift if not strictly managed.
- The presence of a `UnifiedResourceRegistry` and centralized resource provider systems (as described in `README.md`) indicates an intent to centralize resource definitions and orchestration.
- The CLI status and version commands (in `ucore_framework/processing/cli.py`) suggest that runtime state and configuration are loaded and reported from a unified location.

### 2. **Project Structure & Documentation**
- The main source code is organized by domain under `ucore_framework/`, with submodules for core, data, messaging, monitoring, processing, resource, web, etc. (`README.md`, `docs/project-structure-guide.md`)
- The `docs/` directory provides guides and overviews but does not appear to duplicate technical documentation already present in the code (good SSOT practice).
- The `examples/` directory contains example apps that each focus on a specific feature, and a plan is in place (see `ai/reports/improve_plan.md`) to standardize these using unified registration, event-driven patterns, and logging.

### 3. **Code Practices**
- Centralized dependency injection and resource management (`ucore_framework/core/di.py`, `ucore_framework/resource/`) indicate that the main business logic and components retrieve dependencies from a single container or registry.
- Testing code in `tests/` mirrors the source structure, supporting traceability and reducing duplication.
- Observability, logging, and metrics are implemented via domain modules and appear to use centralized providers (Prometheus, loguru).

### 4. **Potential SSOT Violations**
- Multiple configuration files may lead to ambiguity if not clearly documented as layered/overridden sources.
- There is some documentation repetition (e.g., project structure outlined in both `README.md` and `docs/project-structure*.md`), but the information appears consistent and up to date.

## Recommendations

1. **Clarify Configuration Hierarchy**  
   Document which config file is canonical. If configs are layered (base, override, environment-specific), explicitly state the precedence order and merge strategy in documentation.

2. **Centralize Documentation**  
   Consider maintaining a single, auto-generated project structure reference to avoid drift between `README.md` and docs.

3. **Standardize Example Patterns**  
   Continue with the plan in `ai/reports/improve_plan.md` to enforce best practices and unified integration patterns in all examples.

4. **Automate Consistency Checks**  
   Use CI linting to ensure that project structure and configuration documentation remain consistent.

## Conclusion

**UCore** demonstrates strong adherence to the Single Source of Truth principle through centralized resource registries, dependency injection, and modular source organization. The main area for improvement is clarifying the canonical source of configuration and minimizing minor documentation duplication.

**Overall, the repository is architected with SSOT in mind, with only minor improvements needed for full compliance.
