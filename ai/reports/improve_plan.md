# UCore Integration & Usage Improvement Plan

## Objective
Enhance clarity, extensibility, and integration across the UCore framework by standardizing best practices, updating examples, and improving documentation.

---

## Steps

### 1. Audit All Example Projects
- Review each script in the `examples/` directory.
- Identify usage patterns that do not follow best practices (e.g., direct resource instantiation, missing event-driven flows, inconsistent logging).

### 2. Define a Standard Example Template
- Create a template for examples that includes:
  - UnifiedResourceRegistry/component registration
  - EventBus/event-driven integration
  - Loguru logging and tqdm progress
  - Modular structure and OOP patterns

### 3. Refactor Each Example
- Update each example to:
  - Use unified registration and discovery
  - Emit and handle events for cross-domain actions
  - Use loguru for all logging and ProgressManager/tqdm for progress
  - Follow OOP and modularity guidelines

### 4. Add a Full-Stack Example
- Create a new example combining multiple domains (resource, messaging, monitoring, web).
- Demonstrate end-to-end integration and extensibility.

### 5. Document Example Changes
- Add comments and README updates to explain integration patterns and best practices in each example.

### 6. Test All Examples
- Ensure all refactored examples run as expected and demonstrate intended patterns.

## Best Practices Reference

- Organize code by domain (core, data, messaging, monitoring, processing, resource, web).
- Register all resources and components using UnifiedResourceRegistry.
- Use EventBus for cross-domain communication.
- Use loguru for all logging and tqdm for progress.
- Subclass `Component` for new features and use DI for configuration.
- Write modular, reusable code and avoid tight coupling.
- Document and test extensively.

## Next Steps

1. Complete this plan and keep it updated as progress is made.
2. Begin with auditing and refactoring the example projects.
3. Continue with templates, documentation, and API updates.
