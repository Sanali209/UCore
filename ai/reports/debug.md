# Test Failure & Freeze Report

## Group: Timeout/Slow Test

### File: tests/resource/test_resource_manager.py

#### Test: `TestLifecycleManagement.test_shutdown_timeout`

- **Type:** Timeout/Slow Test
- **Description:**  
  This test intentionally sleeps for 35 seconds during resource cleanup to verify that the ResourceManager's shutdown logic correctly handles timeouts. The shutdown timeout is set to 30 seconds, so the test will always take at least 30 seconds to complete, causing the test suite to appear to freeze or hang during this period.
- **Relevant Code:**
  - **Test:**  
    ```python
    async def test_shutdown_timeout(self):
        ...
        async def slow_cleanup():
            await asyncio.sleep(35)  # Longer than timeout
            await resource.cleanup()
        resource.cleanup = slow_cleanup
        ...
        with patch('asyncio.wait_for') as mock_wait_for:
            mock_wait_for.side_effect = asyncio.TimeoutError()
            await manager.start_all_resources()
            await manager.stop_all_resources()
            # Should handle timeout gracefully
            mock_wait_for.assert_called_once()
    ```
  - **ResourceManager:**  
    ```python
    await asyncio.wait_for(
        asyncio.gather(*shutdown_tasks, return_exceptions=True),
        timeout=self._shutdown_timeout
    )
    ```
- **Analysis:**  
  The test is not a deadlock or bug, but a deliberate simulation of a slow resource cleanup to test timeout handling. The ResourceManager's shutdown logic is robust, using asyncio.wait_for to enforce the timeout and logging errors as needed.

- **Recommendation:**  
  If test suite speed is a concern, consider reducing the sleep duration and shutdown timeout for the test, or marking it as a slow test to be skipped in regular runs.

## Group: Async Lifecycle/State Handling

### File: tests/resource/test_resource_manager.py

#### Tests: 
- `TestLifecycleManagement.test_stop_all_resources_success`
- `TestLifecycleManagement.test_stop_all_resources_with_failure`
- `TestLifecycleManagement.test_shutdown_timeout`

- **Type:** Async Lifecycle/State Handling
- **Description:**  
  These tests involve stopping resources and cleanup using async methods. Freezing or hanging can occur if:
    - Resource state transitions are not handled correctly (e.g., not set to READY/CONNECTED).
    - Async cleanup/disconnect methods are not awaited or do not complete.
    - MockResource or ResourceManager logic does not advance state as expected, causing ResourceManager to wait indefinitely for shutdown tasks.
- **Relevant Code:**  
  - MockResource async methods use asyncio.sleep to simulate work, but improper state or missing awaits can cause hangs.
  - ResourceManager uses asyncio.create_task and asyncio.wait_for to manage shutdown, but relies on resources completing their async cleanup/disconnect.
- **Analysis:**  
  If a resource's cleanup/disconnect never completes or its state is not advanced, ResourceManager's shutdown waits indefinitely or until timeout. This can appear as a freeze in the test suite.
- **Recommendation:**  
  - Ensure all async resource methods are properly awaited and advance state as expected.
  - Add timeouts or checks in tests to fail fast if a resource does not complete shutdown.
  - Consider adding debug logging in MockResource and ResourceManager to trace state transitions and task completions during tests.
