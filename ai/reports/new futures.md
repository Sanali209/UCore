The plan will now include a document management system for showing current documents in document tabs, with their content built by MVVM dynamic GUI, and the same for tool tabs.

**Updated Plan:**

1. **Core UI/UX Layer**
   - Window manager with multi-pane, tabbed, and dockable panels (PySide6 MVVM)
   - File explorer and workspace navigation
   - Command palette and menu system
   - **Document Management System:** Tabbed document interface for open documents, each tab using MVVM to build dynamic content
   - **Tool Tabs:** Tabbed tools area, each tool as a dynamic MVVM component

2. **Plugin/Extension System**
   - Dynamic plugin loading/unloading
   - API for third-party extensions (editors, viewers, syntax highlighting, previews)

3. **File System Abstraction**
   - Virtual file system support (local, remote, cloud, archives)
   - File operations (copy, move, rename, delete, search, batch)

4. **Editor/Viewer Components**
   - Text/code editor with syntax highlighting, undo/redo, search/replace
   - Previewers for images, documents, archives, etc.

5. **Task/Process Management**
   - Background task runner (build, search, indexing)
   - Progress visualization (tqdm), logging (loguru)

6. **Event Bus & Messaging**
   - Decoupled communication between UI, plugins, and core logic

7. **Settings & State Management**
   - User/workspace settings, layout persistence, session restore

8. **Monitoring & Debugging**
   - Integrated logging, error reporting, performance metrics

9. **OOP & Extensibility**
   - All components modular, OOP, and plugin-ready

10. **Documentation**
    - Document extension points, developer API, and usage patterns

**Todo List:**
- [ ] Design UI/UX architecture (window manager, panels, navigation, document/tool tabs)
- [ ] Define plugin/extension API and lifecycle
- [ ] Extend file system abstraction for virtual/remote/cloud
- [ ] Integrate editor/viewer components (text, image, doc, archive)
- [ ] Implement background task/process management
- [ ] Connect event bus/messaging for decoupled logic
- [ ] Add settings/state management and persistence
- [ ] Integrate monitoring/logging/debugging
- [ ] Document extension points and developer API
