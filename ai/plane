- odule.

- __Approach:__

  - Use `pytest` as the test runner.
  - Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for mocking dependencies.
  - Use `tqdm` for progress visualization in long-running or integration tests.
  - Use `loguru` for logging within tests where appropriate.
  - Follow OOP principles in test code (e.g., test classes for each main class).
  - Ensure tests are isolated, repeatable, and extensible.

### 3. Test Organization

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of `framework/`.
- For each class/function, create a corresponding test file if it does not exist.
- Group related tests into classes (e.g., `TestApp`, `TestComponent`, etc.).
- Use fixtures for setup/teardown and dependency injection.

### 4. Coverage Checklist

- [ ] __debug_utilities__: Test `DebugMetrics`, `ComponentDebugger`.
- [ ] __core__: Test `App`, `Component`, `Config`, `DI/Container`, `Plugin/PluginManager`, `SettingsManager`, `TimeMeasure`, `UndoSystem`.
- [ ] __data__: Test adapters (`SQLAlchemyAdapter`, `DiskCacheAdapter`, `MongoDBAdapter`), view models, and ORM classes.
- [ ] __desktop/ui__: Test `PySide6Adapter`, `FletAdapter`.
- [ ] __messaging__: Test `Event`, `EventBus`, `RedisAdapter`, `EventBusToRedisBridge`, etc.
- [ ] __monitoring__: Test `Logging`, `HTTPMetricsAdapter`, `Observability`, `ProgressManager` and visualizers.
- [ ] __processing__: Test `TaskQueueAdapter`, CLI helpers, worker management, CPU task adapters, and task functions.
- [ ] __resource__: Test resource management, pools, registries, exceptions, secrets, and all resource types.
- [ ] __web__: Test `HttpServer` and related routing/middleware.

### 5. Implementation Steps

1. __Audit existing tests__: Identify which classes/functions already have tests and which do not.

2. __Create missing test files__: For uncovered modules/classes, create new test files in the appropriate location.

3. __Write/expand tests__:

   - Cover all public methods, edge cases, and error handling.
   - Use mocks for external dependencies (DB, network, etc.).
   - Use parameterized tests for broad input coverage.
   - Add progress visualization and logging where useful.

4. __Run and measure coverage__: Use `pytest-cov` to measure coverage and ensure all code paths are tested.

5. __Refactor for maintainability__: Ensure tests are modular, readable, and follow OOP/test best practices.

### 6. Extensibility & Best Practices

- Design tests so new features/classes can be easily added.
- Use base test classes and fixtures for shared logic.
- Document test cases and expected behaviors.
- Integrate with CI for automatic test runs and coverage reporting.

__Next Steps:__

- Audit the `tests/` directory to map current coverage.
- Begin implementing missing tests as per the checklist above.
- Use `pytest`, `tqdm`, and `loguru` as described.
