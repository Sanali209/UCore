ll Python files in the `framework` directory have been listed.\
__Next steps for logger replacement in all files:__

1. For each file in `framework/`, search for usage of `Logging().get_logger`, `LoggerWrapper`, or any import from `framework.monitoring.logging`.

2. Replace these with direct usage of `from loguru import logger`.

   - For named loggers, use `logger.bind(logger_name=...)` if context is needed.
   - Remove any custom logger wrappers or caching logic.

3. Ensure progress reporting continues to use `tqdm` and `loguru` as in `progress.py`.

4. Update tests and documentation accordingly.

__Updated Todo List:__

- [x] Identify current logger implementation and usage
- [x] Review logger API and integration points
- [x] Analyze loguru and tqdm integration
- [x] Plan replacement steps
- [x] List all Python files in framework for logger replacement
- [ ] For each framework file, plan logger replacement details
