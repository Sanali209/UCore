# Internal Event Bus Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Overview
Implement Internal Event Bus for UCore Framework - a dedicated module for in-process communication between components.

## üìã Phases and Steps

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
#### Current Step: **IN PROGRESS**
- [x] Analyze current framework architecture and patterns
- [x] Design event hierarchy and types
- [x] Plan integration points with existing framework
- [ ] Create detailed implementation plan
- [ ] ~Review and approve plan~ (waiting for user)

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
#### Steps (execute after plan approval):
- [ ] Create `framework/events.py` - Base event classes and types
- [ ] Create `framework/event_bus.py` - Main EventBus implementation
- [ ] Update `framework/__init__.py` to export new modules
- [ ] Create simple unit tests for event bus core functionality
- [ ] ~~Test basic event publishing/subscribing~~

### Phase 3: Framework Integration
#### Steps:
- [ ] Integrate EventBus into `framework/app.py` as core service
- [ ] Extend `framework/component.py` with event subscription helpers
- [ ] Add automatic lifecycle event publishing
- [ ] Update configuration update mechanism to use events
- [ ] ~~Integration tests~~

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
#### Steps:
- [ ] Implement middleware system for event processing
- [ ] Add event filtering and routing capabilities
- [ ] Implement event persistence for debugging
- [ ] Add event monitoring and metrics
- [ ] ~~Advanced feature tests~~

### Phase 5: Documentation and Examples
#### Steps:
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Write usage examples and best practices guide
- [ ] Create integration examples
- [ ] Final performance testing

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### Core Components

#### 1. Event Base System (`framework/events.py`)
```python
@dataclass
class Event(ABC):
    event_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    source: str
    data: Dict[str, Any]

class ComponentStartedEvent(Event): ...
class ComponentStoppedEvent(Event): ...
class ConfigUpdatedEvent(Event): ...
```

#### 2. Event Bus (`framework/event_bus.py`)
```python
class EventBus:
    def subscribe(self, event_type, handler): ...
    def publish(self, event): ...
    async def publish_async(self, event): ...
    def add_middleware(self, middleware): ...
```

#### 3. Framework Integration Points
- **App Class**: Register EventBus as singleton service
- **Component Class**: Add event subscription helpers
- **Configuration**: Use events for config updates
- **DI Container**: Make EventBus available for injection

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Typed Events**: Use dataclass-based events for type safety
2. **Async Support**: Both sync and async publishing methods
3. **Middleware Chain**: Pluggable event processing pipeline
4. **Handler Priority**: Support for ordered event processing
5. **Error Resilience**: Isolated error handling per handler
6. **Framework Integration**: Seamless integration with existing patterns

### Integration Strategy

1. **Minimal Impact**: Add event bus without breaking existing code
2. **Optional Usage**: Components can opt-in to event system
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Start with framework events, expand to user events
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Follow existing UCore design patterns

## üìä Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Events can be published and subscribed to
- [ ] Both sync and async event handling supported
- [ ] Framework lifecycle events are published automatically
- [ ] Components can subscribe to events easily
- [ ] Error handling doesn't break event publishing

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance impact minimal (<5% overhead)
- [ ] Memory usage efficient (no memory leaks)
- [ ] Thread-safe event publishing
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] Full type safety with mypy compliance

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Event creation and validation
- Event publishing/subscribing
- Handler management and cleanup
- Middleware functionality

### Integration Tests
- Event bus with existing components
- Framework lifecycle integration
- Configuration update events
- Error handling scenarios

### Performance Tests
- Event publishing throughput
- Memory usage with many handlers
- Async vs sync performance comparison

## üìã Step-by-Step Implementation Checklist

### Step 1: Core Event Classes **[COMPLETE ‚úÖ]**
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED
**Files:** `framework/events.py`
**Goal:** Create base Event classes and common event types
**Validation:** ‚úÖ All event types created successfully, validation tests pass
**Results:**
- Created Event base class with automatic source detection
- Implemented framework events: ComponentStartedEvent, ComponentStoppedEvent, AppStartedEvent, AppStoppedEvent, ConfigUpdatedEvent
- Added UserEvent for custom events
- Created EventFilter for selective subscription
- ‚úÖ All tests pass: event creation, inheritance, filtering

### Step 2: EventBus Implementation **[COMPLETE ‚úÖ]**
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED
**Files:** `framework/event_bus.py`
**Goal:** Implement publish/subscribe mechanism with middleware support
**Validation:** ‚úÖ All publish/subscribe tests pass, middleware works, error handling validated
**Results:**
- Created full EventBus class with EventHandlerInfo internal class
- Implemented sync/async publish methods
- Added middleware pipeline with both sync/async support
- Built handler priority system (higher priority executed first)
- Added comprehensive error isolation per handler
- Implemented event filtering with EventFilter class
- Created handler management (add/remove/clear/get operations)
- ‚úÖ All 10 comprehensive tests pass including edge cases

### Step 3: Framework Integration
**Status:** PENDING
**Files:** `framework/app.py`, `framework/component.py`
**Goal:** Integrate event bus into framework lifecycle
**Validation:** Framework publishes lifecycle events automatically

### Step 4: Unit Tests
**Status:** PENDING
**Files:** `tests/test_event_bus.py`
**Goal:** Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
**Validation:** All tests pass, edge cases covered

### Step 5: Documentation
**Status:** PENDING
**Files:** `docs/event_bus_guide.md`, `docs/event_bus_api.md`
**Goal:** Complete documentation and examples
**Validation:** New developers can understand and use the system

## üö¶ Ready for Execution

**Current Status:** Plan completed, ready for step-by-step implementation

**Next Action:** Begin with Step 1 - Implement Event Base Classes

**Execution Approach:**
1. Implement each step completely
2. Test and validate each step
3. Only proceed to next step after validation
4. Document any deviations from plan

**Revisions:** Any changes to this plan will be documented here
- **Revision 1:** Added step-by-step validation checkpoints
- **Revision 2:** Enhanced testing strategy with performance tests
