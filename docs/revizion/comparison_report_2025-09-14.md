# Framework Revision Report - 2025-09-14

Based on the analysis of the design document (`docs/dizdok.md`) and the current file structure of the `framework` directory, here is a comparison of what is planned versus what is implemented, highlighting the missing components.

### **Summary of Implemented vs. Missing Features**

The current implementation provides a solid foundation, covering many core aspects, UI adapters, and the basic simulation module. However, several advanced features and entire modules described in the design document are missing.

---

### **Detailed Breakdown of Missing Components**

Here is a list of features and modules that are specified in the design document but are not present in the `d:\UCore\framework` directory:

**1. Core & Structure:**
*   `framework/registry.py`: The design document specifies a separate file for the component registry, which seems to be currently handled within `di.py` or `app.py`.
*   `framework/persistence/` directory: A dedicated directory for persistence-related logic, including repository patterns and ORM adapters, is missing.
*   `framework/adapters/` directory: The design suggests a dedicated directory for various adapters, although `redis_adapter.py` exists at the root level.

**2. Transport Layer:**
*   **RPC Adapters**: There is no implementation for gRPC, Thrift, or JSON-RPC adapters.
*   **Additional Message Bus Adapters**: While a Redis adapter exists, support for other message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka is missing.
*   **Internal Event Bus**: A dedicated module for in-process communication between components is not implemented.

**3. Persistence:**
*   **ORM/ODM Adapters**: The existing `db.py` is generic. Specific, high-level adapters for libraries like SQLAlchemy, Tortoise, or Peewee are missing.
*   **Database Migrations**: There is no integration with migration tools like Alembic or a custom solution.

**4. Auth & Security (Entire Module Missing):**
*   This is the most significant missing part. There are no files related to:
    *   Strategy-based authentication (JWT, OAuth2, API keys).
    *   A policy engine or Access Control List (ACL) helpers.
    *   Abstractions for secret management (e.g., Hashicorp Vault).

**5. Observability:**
*   **Tracing**: While `observability.py` exists, explicit integration with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing is not present.
*   **Health Checks**: A dedicated health check endpoint or module is not implemented.

**6. Utilities:**
*   **Task Queue Integration**: Support for dedicated task queues like Celery or RQ is missing.
*   **Rate Limiting**: There are no helper modules for rate limiting API requests or other operations.

**7. Environment/Simulation Module (Partially Implemented):**
*   The base classes (`Entity`, `Controller`) exist, but the following key components are missing:
    *   Specialized entity types like `Pawn`, `BotAgent`.
    *   Action and sensor abstractions (`Action`, `Path`, `Camera`).
    *   Input/Output modules like `MouseObserver`, `ScreenCapturer`, `OCRModule`.
    *   Rendering integrations (Pygame, OpenCV).

**8. Blackboard & Behavior Trees (Entire Module Missing):**
*   There is no implementation for a `Blackboard` system or any components related to Behavior Trees (`Node`, `ActionNode`, `Selector`, `Sequence`, Decorators). This is a major feature for building complex agent logic that is currently absent.

### **Conclusion**

The framework is currently at a stage similar to the **v0.3 or early v1.0** described in its own roadmap. The core application lifecycle, DI, configuration, logging, and UI adapters are in place.

To align with the complete vision in `dizdok.md`, the next development steps should focus on:
1.  Building out the entire **Auth & Security** module.
2.  Implementing the **Behavior Trees & Blackboard** system for advanced simulations.
3.  Adding more **Persistence** and **Transport** adapters.
4.  Completing the **Environment/Simulation** module with I/O and rendering capabilities.
