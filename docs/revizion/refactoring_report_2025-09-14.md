# UCore Framework Refactoring Report - 2025-09-14

## 1. Introduction

This report details the refactoring of the UCore framework, undertaken to improve consistency, modularity, and future-readiness. The following files were analyzed and updated:

- `framework/config.py`
- `framework/di.py`
- `framework/component.py`
- `framework/plugins.py`
- `framework/app.py`

## 2. Key Improvements

### 2.1. Enhanced Configuration (`framework/config.py`)

- **Nested Environment Variables**: The `Config` class now supports nested keys from environment variables (e.g., `UCORE_LOGGING_LEVEL` maps to `logging.level`).
- **Automatic Type Casting**: Environment variables are automatically cast to `bool`, `int`, or `float`, reducing boilerplate code.
- **Improved Error Handling**: The class now raises more specific exceptions for YAML parsing errors.

### 2.2. Robust Dependency Injection (`framework/di.py`)

- **Circular Dependency Detection**: The `Container` can now detect and raise a `CircularDependencyError`, preventing infinite recursion.
- **Explicit Registration**: The API is now more explicit, with separate methods for class registration (`register`) and instance registration (`register_instance`).
- **Custom Exceptions**: Introduced `DependencyError`, `CircularDependencyError`, and `NoProviderError` for clearer error messages.

### 2.3. Improved Component Interface (`framework/component.py`)

- **App Instance Injection**: Components are now initialized with a reference to the `App` instance, allowing them to access core services.
- **Type Hinting**: Added type hints for better static analysis and developer experience.

### 2.4. Decoupled Plugin Management (`framework/plugins.py`)

- **PluginManager**: Plugin loading is now handled by a dedicated `PluginManager`, separating concerns from the `App` class.
- **Abstract Base Class**: The `Plugin` class is now an abstract base class (`ABC`), ensuring that subclasses implement the required `register` method.

### 2.5. Streamlined Application Lifecycle (`framework/app.py`)

- **Simplified `run` Method**: The `run` method is now more concise, with clearer separation of concerns for argument parsing, bootstrapping, and event loop management.
- **Decoupled Core Services**: Core services like `Config` and `Logging` are now set up in a dedicated `_setup_core_services` method.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling has been improved for more reliable and graceful shutdowns.

## 3. Conclusion

The refactoring has resulted in a more robust, modular, and maintainable framework. The improved architecture provides a solid foundation for future development and extension.
