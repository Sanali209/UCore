# Detailed Checklist for the Third Iteration (v1.0)

This plan incorporates the new requirement for a background task system and focuses on making the framework robust, observable, and ready for building production-grade backend applications.

## Iteration Goals

- Integrate message bus support for building event-driven architectures
- Implement a comprehensive observability stack (metrics and tracing)
- Introduce a robust background task and database migration system
- Expand the Environment/Simulation module with practical, real-world controllers
